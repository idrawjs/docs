# Become an iDraw.js Sponsor

iDraw.js is an MIT licensed open source project and completely free to use. The tremendous amount of effort needed to maintain this framework and develop new features for the project is only made sustainable thanks to the generous financial backing of our sponsors.

## How to Sponsor

Sponsorships can be done via [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/idrawjs) ([https://opencollective.com/idrawjs](https://opencollective.com/idrawjs)). Both monthly-recurring sponsorships and one-time donations are accepted. Recurring sponsorships are entitled to logo placements as specified in Sponsorship Tiers.
